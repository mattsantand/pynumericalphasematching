===================================
Welcome to PyNumPy's documentation!
===================================
Greetings! Welcome to PyNumericalPhasematching, aka pynumpy.
This Python package is an API for the analysis of classical optical,
`nonlinear optical processes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_optics#Frequency-mixing_processes>`_
(mainly three wave mixing) in guiding structures.

This package has been developed by M. Santandrea (`email <mailto: mattsantand@gmail.com>`_), `Integrated Quantum Optics
<https://physik.uni-paderborn.de/en/silberhorn/>`_ group, University of Paderborn, Germany.
The author thanks M. Massaro for the help in packaging this API and B. Brecht for the development of the
:class:`pynumpm.jsa.Pump` class.
